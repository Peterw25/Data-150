One topic that is interesting in relation to data science and human development is how blockchain technology could revolutionize the future in numerous ways. Blockchain technology is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack or cheat the system. One of the primary ways where blockchain has a strong influence is within the financial systems. The technology will allow anyone to exchange money faster, more efficiently and more securely. The reason why it will allow exchanging at a faster rate is because automated or digital communication is being processed on pre-built algorithms. The way blockchain allows for better efficiency and more secure is through advanced cryptography, this makes it resilient to unauthorized changes and hacks. With many hacks that have occurred in the financial systems in the past few years some notable companies include target, Verizon and Deloitte. Using the blockchain decentralized, it would allow for storage in iCloud to be more secure and protect against hacks. Although this is still new technology that has yet to be adopted on a larger scale, the approach that it offers is revolutionary and can change the lives of many. This is a very interesting topic of discussion as it provides many new solutions to serve people on a world wide scale.
