Hello, my name is Peter Welling and I am from Bayport, New York located on Long Island. In high school I was an athlete who played baseball and was planning to play at the college level. I had interest in the service academy schools, specifically the US Naval Academy and the Merchant Marine Academy. I had determined that these two schools were where I wanted to attend. The application process is long and rigorous and took me about six months to complete. I had completed most of the application and received my congressman nomination to both academies but the medical test is where the problems began. I had been disqualified because of my color vision and had lost any hope of attending either academy. I had applied to no other school and was forced to attend community college. There, I was determined to transfer within a year and that meant I had to be focused from the start. I am happy to start my next chapter at William and Mary and to see what the future holds.
My interests are centered around my major, economics, and the development of cryptocurrency, specifically blockchain technology. I have interests in economics because I think learning about how scarce resources play a major role in how we make decisions is important. I think there is a lot to learn within the blockchain world and I am excited to see what the future has to hold. 
I think data science is the use of scientific methods, processes and algorithms to make strides of development within various fields of technology. I think it can be used to create solutions to important problems around the world and can improve the future around the topic of human development. Data science could be used inorder to find solutions through its unique way of studying humans in various topics. Data science provides unique answers that in some instances cannot be found in other forms of studying. With these unique solutions it can be used to improve the lives of people, the environment, our understanding of ourselves or nature, business and economics.
