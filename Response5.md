	Selim Jahan describes human development as “development of the people (capital), for the people (translated to the lives of the people) and by the people (people are not only receiving but active participants in the process).” In the process of development some nations have no struggle to further develop but rather other countries have had a difficult time trying to achieve the same goal. As a humanity, we have missed our expectation of what the potential outcome could be in human development. Not every nation has the technology, the resources and the freedoms to make the leap in human development. For example, Amartya Sen compared China and India on their progress in development. “India is far behind China in development but both carried out similar tactics, one reason is because India has poor educational resources which produced half the population being illiterate” (Sen). Data Science plays an important role in the advancing human condition. Amartya Sen describes it as “an attempt to see development as a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy” and the  expansion of freedoms is viewed as “the primary end” and the principle means of development” (Sen). In these quotes, Sen confirms that data science plays a key role in the advancement of the human condition. Complexity plays a major role in advancing the understanding of global human development processes and their multitude of dimensions. A key resource to understanding the complexity is through economic models which, according to Barder, have not  been accurate in predicting. Further describing how difficult it is to predict economic outcomes. Another example was the addition of the Washington Consensus. This was introduced to fix the failures and hope to create a roadway to economic development. It did not work along with the Harold-Domar model, Solow Model and the Ajaokuta Steel project, further describing how complex economic development is. Yes, to predict solutions to the world's problems, computer science and statistics with global human development would be sufficient. The previous models failed to use these technologies and loopholes were found when the models failed. With these problems new solutions have risen and could be used as a benefit in the future. There is hope in selecting the best future path for humanity, over the course of different trial and errors there have been advancements in what works and what doesn't. For example when Amartya Sen was comparing India and China, the take away was that a democratic government does a better job at protecting famine rather than a socialist nation. If the information is used correctly, the future path of development for humanity is in a good position.
