When the pandemic started in late winter of 2020, many new changes were enforced following the impact the pandemic had on society. In my field of study, economics more specifically, how economics is related to the flow of currency and how it was impacted along the way, there were many new changes that came as a result. A major result from the pandemic was the amount of jobs lost, this created an imbalance in the economy and there needed action to be taken. One of the actions that was taken to counteract this was the input of money from the economy. As this may seem like a good thing, in some scenarios it was over done and there are many complications that are a result of this. One major problem that resulted was the influx in inflation. The government had handed people money and the majority of money was placed into the stock market. Now this may seem good but it means that the majority of people did not need the money and rapid inflation was on the horizon. Stocks began to increase at never before seen rates and the inflation never caught up yet. Today inflation is a direct result of all the money poured in and as an economist would say if there is inflation there needs to be contractionary fiscal policy. This would mean an increase in taxes and less government spending. Nowadays, there is an increase in taxes but spending is continuing to rise, this is a problem and the future may be worse than people expect, with all great climbs there's a massive fall. 
Another problem that came as a result was the unemployment rate, with all the money that was being poured into society, people didn't feel the need to return to work. This left businesses struggling while the consumer was still in good financial standing. This is a major imbalance and the handing out of money costs the small businesses lots of employment. Another problem with inflation is the worker vs economy expectation. As inflation increases the worker expects to receive a raise to compensate for his normal salary but as this continues to happen it increases inflation and there is no stopping it unless there is a halt on raises which then people will begin to leave and look for other work. It's a tricky situation that if approached correctly can be fixed. There are many recommendations moving forward. One of them is to increase taxes and decrease government spending inorder to reduce the amount of inflation that is circulating the economy. This will lead to a healthier lifestyle as well as a more comfortable lifestyle. The economy will be more stable and future implications will be protected along the way. 
On the notion of working from home now as the new normal initiative. There are positives as well as negatives that come along with it. A positive is that some people enjoy the new work environment and zoom has been a great addition to compensating for this change. A problem that results from this is that work is harder in some aspects. For example someone in sales who was hired to meet with clients and conduct business on a face to face platform are now at a disadvantage. Business begins to become a longer road to completion as the in person trust is lost between the client and seller.
