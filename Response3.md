Data 150 Ted Talk Video

At the Karolinska Institute Hans Rosling mentioned that the students had scored a 1.8 on his confidence interval. He compares the scores to chimpanzees and comments that they are smarter since he inferred their score would have been a 2.5. He also talks about the Swedish professors saying that their score was a 2.4 putting them on par with the chimpanzees. The significance of the results from his informal study on preconceived ideas shows that “the problem was not ignorance it was preconceived ideas”. 
Social change took place in Asia before economic growth. As families became smaller and family planning became more common, life expectancy increased for these countries and along came the economic growth. This was important because it became a leading factor to triggering economic growth.
The relationship between child mortality and GDP per capita is as stated. As the GDP per capita increases, the child survival rate increases and as the GDP per capita decreases, child survival rate decreases. 
In terms of economic distribution, from 1962 to 2003 the speed of development for each country is different but every country has made an advancement with their income. Although the countries are moving in the right direction, within a country the income distribution has increased and created a bigger gap between their own citizens. 
Throughout the video, Hans Rosling used data to describe global human development in terms of high spatial and temporal resolutions. This is significant because it gives a first hand account on where the issues are in the world and allows for a better understanding, in order to improve upon these issues. It provides solutions to important issues around the world. For example in the video, Hans reported data on life expectancy and children per family. His data showed as the families became smaller they started to live longer lives. This sparked the adoption of family planning in Asian countries and allowed for a great improvement upon their lives.
Hans Rosling's work with the Gapminder project was significant in contributing towards advancing the intersection of data science and global human development because it wrote software where they could link important data and produce data sets where it could be accessed by a bigger audience. It's important because it is the stepping stones to making a search function where the data can be copied to a searchable database and be published to the world. This would allow for all types of data to be public and allow for more resources to be public and allow for more solutions to be available in the future.
