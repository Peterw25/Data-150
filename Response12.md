Private companies as well as the government have been recording personal information from people through facial recognition systems. Although this may make it easy for entering your phone faster or using face recognition to enter a secure subject, it has many problems that go along with it. One reason why it is an important problem is because it violates our privacy. Letting the government and large corporations keep information regarding our identity allows them to track us in a public setting in everything we do. Another reason why it is a problem is because it denies people the right of consent. People are not given the choice of whether or not we want to be further tracked but rather it is done automatically. Denying the right of consent people are denied the control of their own images. The last reason why it is a bad thing is because it could be used out of proportion. The technology should be used in a restricted way but instead misleads us and follows our every move. 
Although there are negatives to this technology there are positives if used in the correct manner. The technology could be used inorder to stop crime or track down criminals and keep the public safe. This could prevent future disasters occuring in the world as well as keeping society safe if criminals are loose in public settings. The government should absolutely regulate the use of facial recognition. Their use should be limited in the fact that it should be used only in a security setting. Meaning, it should be used solely for the purpose of protection and not in a way that violates people's everyday privacy. This would keep the public content as well as keeping them safe.
